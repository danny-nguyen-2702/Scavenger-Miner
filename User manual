## Introduction

Welcome to the Scavenger-Miner user manual! This guide will help you understand how to use the miner effectively and maximize your participation in the Midnight Scavenger Mine token distribution.

### What is Scavenger-Miner?

Scavenger-Miner is a CPU-based mining application that participates in Midnight Network's fair token distribution. It uses the AshMaize proof-of-work algorithm, which is specifically designed to work well on ordinary computers without requiring specialized hardware like ASICs or high-end GPUs.

### How Does It Work?

The miner:
1. Fetches cryptographic challenges from the Scavenger Mine API
2. Solves these challenges using your computer's CPU
3. Submits valid solutions to earn NIGHT tokens
4. Operates in a profit-sharing model between you and the operator

## Configuration

### Creating Your Wallets File

The most important configuration step is creating your `wallets.txt` file.

#### Step 1: Register Your Wallet Addresses

Before adding addresses to the miner, you must register them with the Scavenger Mine portal:

1. Visit the Scavenger Mine registration portal
2. Connect your Cardano wallet (Lace, Nami, Eternl, etc.)
3. Accept the Token End User Terms
4. Sign the registration message with your wallet

#### Step 2: Create wallets.txt

Create a plain text file named `wallets.txt` in the same directory as the miner executable file.

**Format:**
- One wallet address per line
- No empty lines
- No commas, quotes, or other punctuation
- Only Cardano mainnet addresses

**Example wallets.txt:**
```
addr1qxdvy9xc0a3ruzzp3ty9upcrgns6fdszcjeqlxx9uzdjcj5ysr0vsg879neqkq7u2yg6y9f0v2zflr2888azlz080zxqk4cftg
addr1q8z0cs2rxr8l367rpj7tcl60s2z28gvl8dp9pmmpkvmftccyhc8a2kgej5khvwlsqtv5q0nymc4yud2cmx39tgfv28wsfu2w4k
addr1q892mmgal67y7zjkgf5tlddasv7pshgmyqy2a9zdrrks8s5jur7vavwtw97hr00ndrkddgxy6dk4tnle478slr37h8qsljpqll
```

#### Tips for Multiple Wallets

- **Round-robin mining**: The miner cycles through wallets, so all addresses get equal mining time
- **Optimal number**: 5-10 wallets works well for most users
- **Too many wallets**: Using 30+ wallets may reduce efficiency due to challenge synchronization

---

## Running the Miner

### Basic Usage

**Windows:**
```cmd
scavenger-miner.exe
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./scavenger-miner
```

This runs the miner with default settings:
- 50% CPU usage
- Reads from `wallets.txt` in the current directory

### Recommended Usage

For most users, we recommend starting with 75% CPU usage:

**Windows:**
```cmd
scavenger-miner.exe wallets.txt 75
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
./scavenger-miner wallets.txt 75
```

### Custom Wallets File Location

If your wallets file is in a different location:

```bash
scavenger-miner /path/to/my_wallets.txt 75
```

### Running in the Background

**Linux/macOS (using screen):**
```bash
# Start a screen session
screen -S miner

# Run the miner
./scavenger-miner wallets.txt 75

# Detach: Press Ctrl+A, then D

# Reattach later
screen -r miner
```

**Linux/macOS (using nohup):**
```bash
nohup ./scavenger-miner wallets.txt 75 > miner.log 2>&1 &
```

**Windows (using Task Scheduler):**
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger (e.g., "At startup")
4. Action: Start a program
5. Program: `C:\path\to\scavenger-miner.exe`
6. Arguments: `wallets.txt 75`

## CPU Usage Configuration

### Understanding CPU Usage Levels

The second parameter controls how many CPU threads the miner uses:

| Setting | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `25` | Uses 25% of CPU cores | Background mining while working |
| `50` | Uses 50% of CPU cores | Balanced mining during normal use (default) |
| `75` | Uses 75% of CPU cores | Recommended for most users |
| `100` | Uses all CPU cores | Maximum performance (use with caution) |

### How It Works

The miner calculates the number of threads based on your CPU:

```
Threads = (Total CPU Cores × CPU Percentage) / 100
```

**Examples:**

- **4-core CPU with 50%:**
  ```
  Threads = (4 × 50) / 100 = 2 threads
  ```

- **8-core CPU with 75%:**
  ```
  Threads = (8 × 75) / 100 = 6 threads
  ```

- **16-core CPU with 100%:**
  ```
  Threads = (16 × 100) / 100 = 16 threads
  ```

### Choosing the Right CPU Setting

#### For Desktop Computers

**Gaming/workstation:**
- While gaming: `25%` or `50%`
- Idle/overnight: `75%`

**Office/productivity:**
- During work: `50%`
- After hours: `75%`

**Dedicated mining:**
- 24/7 mining: `75%`

#### For Laptops

**Important considerations:**
- Heat management is critical
- Battery life impact
- Potential performance throttling

**Recommended settings:**
- On battery: `25%` (or don't mine)
- Plugged in, with cooling: `50%` or `75%`

#### For Servers/VPS

**Cloud instances:**
- Cost-optimized: `75%`
- Maximum performance: `100%`

**Watch for:**
- CPU usage limits in your hosting agreement
- Increased costs due to sustained high usage

### Monitoring CPU Usage

**Windows (Task Manager):**
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc
2. Performance tab
3. Check CPU usage percentage

**Linux:**
```bash
htop
```
or
```bash
top
```

**macOS (Activity Monitor):**
1. Applications → Utilities → Activity Monitor
2. CPU tab
3. Check % CPU column

## Managing Your Wallets

### Adding New Wallets

1. **Register the new wallet** on the Scavenger Mine portal
2. **Stop the miner** (Ctrl+C)
3. **Edit wallets.txt** and add the new address
4. **Restart the miner**

### Removing Wallets

1. **Stop the miner** (Ctrl+C)
2. **Edit wallets.txt** and remove the address
3. **Restart the miner**

> ⚠️ **Note**: Removing a wallet does NOT transfer its earned solutions to other wallets. Any solutions already mined for that wallet remain associated with it.

### Wallet Rotation

The miner uses a **round-robin** algorithm for user wallet selection:

**Example with 3 wallets (ratio 1:9):**
```
Cycle 1:
  - Solution 1: Owner
  - Solution 2: User Wallet #1
  - Solution 3: User Wallet #2
  - Solution 4: User Wallet #3
  - Solution 5: User Wallet #1
  - Solution 6: User Wallet #2
  - Solution 7: User Wallet #3
  - Solution 8: User Wallet #1
  - Solution 9: User Wallet #2
  - Solution 10: User Wallet #3

Cycle 2 starts with Owner again...
```

This ensures **fair distribution** across all your wallets.

---

## Solution Records and Receipts

### Understanding Crypto Receipts

When the miner successfully submits a solution to Scavenger Mine, it receives a **crypto receipt**:

```json
{
  "preimage": "0019c96b6a30ee38addr_test1qq...",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T08:45:25.249Z",
  "signature": "4904f6d82f7075ac21dec9e9..."
}
```

**Components:**

- **Preimage**: The data that was hashed to find the solution
- **Timestamp**: When the server accepted the solution
- **Signature**: Cryptographic proof from Scavenger Mine server

### Solution Record Files

Every user solution is exported to the `solutions/` directory:

**Filename format:**
```
solutions/{WALLET_ADDRESS}_{CHALLENGE_ID}.json
```

**Example:**
```
solutions/addr1qxdvy9xc0a3ruzzp3ty9upcrgns6fdszcjeqlxx9uzdjcj5ysr0vsg879neqkq7u2yg6y9f0v2zflr2888azlz080zxqk4cftg_D03C13.json
```

**Full solution record:**
```json
{
  "wallet_address": "addr_test1qq4dl3nhr0axurgcrpun9xyp04pd2r2dwu5x7eeam98psv6dhxlde8ucclv2p46hm077ds4vzelf5565fg3ky794uhrq5up0he",
  "challenge_id": "**D07C10",
  "nonce": "0019c96b6a30ee38",
  "found_at": "2025-10-19T08:45:23Z",
  "submitted_at": "2025-10-19T08:45:25Z",
  "crypto_receipt": {
    "preimage": "...",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-19T08:45:25.249Z",
    "signature": "..."
  },
  "status": "submitted"
}
```

### Why Are These Important?

1. **Proof of Work**: Crypto receipts prove you submitted valid solutions
2. **Dispute Resolution**: Can be used if allocation discrepancies arise
3. **Verification**: Independent auditors can verify your solutions
4. **Record Keeping**: Personal archive of your mining activity

### Backing Up Your Solutions

**Recommended backup schedule:**
- Daily: Copy `solutions/` directory to another location
- Weekly: Archive and compress older solution files

**Backup commands:**

**Windows:**
```cmd
xcopy solutions backup\solutions /E /I
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
cp -r solutions/ backup/solutions-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

---

## Profit Sharing Explained

### How Profit Sharing Works

The miner operates on a **cycle-based** profit-sharing model:

**Ratio Format:** `OWNER:USER`

**Example ratios:**

| Ratio | Owner % | User % | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1:9 | 10% | 90% | User-favorable ratio |
| 2:8 | 20% | 80% | Balanced ratio |
| 3:7 | 30% | 70% | Operator-favorable ratio |
| 1:4 | 20% | 80% | Simple 1-in-5 split |


### Checking Current Ratio

The current ratio is displayed at startup:

```
💰 Profit Sharing Ratio: 1:19
   - Owner solutions: 1
   - User solutions: 19

```

You can also check the session statistics any time:

```
📊 Session Statistics:
   Total solutions: 200
   Owner solutions: 10 (5.0%)
   User solutions: 190 (95.0%)
   Runtime: 2h 15m
```

### Is This Fair?

**Yes, and here's why:**

1. **You provide the hardware**: Your CPU does the work
2. **Direct submissions**: Your solutions go directly to Scavenger Mine
3. **You receive crypto receipts**: Proof of your mining
4. **Tokens allocated to YOUR wallets**: No intermediary holding
5. **Operator earns for infrastructure**: API hosting, development, support

Think of it like a mining pool fee, but you maintain custody of your tokens throughout the process.

## Performance Optimization

### Maximizing Your Hash Rate

#### 1. CPU Selection

**Best CPUs for mining:**
- Modern CPUs with high single-thread performance
- CPUs with large L3 cache (8MB+)
- Desktop CPUs generally outperform laptop CPUs

**Example good CPUs:**
- AMD Ryzen 5 5600 or better
- Intel Core i5-12400 or better
- Apple M1/M2 (excellent single-thread performance)

#### 2. System Optimization

**Windows:**
```
1. Set Power Plan to "High Performance":
   Control Panel → Power Options → High Performance

2. Disable CPU throttling:
   Power Options → Change plan settings → 
   Advanced → Processor power management → 
   Minimum/Maximum processor state: 100%

3. Close unnecessary background applications

4. Disable Windows Search indexing (temporarily)
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Set CPU governor to performance
sudo cpupower frequency-set -g performance

# Disable CPU frequency scaling
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
```

**macOS:**
```
1. Connect to power adapter
2. Prevent sleep:
   System Preferences → Energy Saver → 
   Prevent computer from sleeping: checked

3. Close unnecessary applications
```

#### 3. Cooling Considerations

**For sustained mining:**

1. **Ensure good airflow**
   - Desktop: Keep case well-ventilated
   - Laptop: Use a cooling pad
   - Clean dust from fans/heatsinks

2. **Monitor temperatures:**
   - Keep CPU under 80°C
   - Most CPUs throttle at 95-100°C

3. **Thermal throttling signs:**
   - Hash rate decreases over time
   - CPU frequency drops
   - System becomes unstable

#### 4. ROM Cache Optimization

The miner caches the ROM to avoid reinitializing:

```
♻️  ROM cache hit - reusing existing ROM
```

**What this means:**
- First solution: ~8-10 seconds ROM initialization
- Subsequent solutions same challenge: 0 seconds initialization

**Tips:**
- The cache works automatically
- Especially beneficial when mining multiple wallets
- Most effective with fewer, longer-running challenges

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "No wallets file found"

**Symptoms:**
```
❌ Error: Wallets file not found: wallets.txt
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check that `wallets.txt` exists in the same directory as the executable
2. Verify the filename is exactly `wallets.txt` (not `wallets.txt.txt`)
3. Try specifying the full path:
   ```bash
   scavenger-miner --wallets /full/path/to/wallets.txt
   ```


#### Issue: High CPU but Low Hash Rate

**Symptoms:**
- CPU usage at 100%
- Solutions taking much longer than expected
- System responsive but miner slow

**Causes:**
- Thermal throttling
- Background processes competing
- Power settings limiting CPU

## Advanced Topics

### Running Multiple Instances

You can run multiple miner instances for different wallet sets:

**Setup:**
```
scavenger-miner/
├── instance1/
│   ├── scavenger-miner
│   └── wallets.txt
└── instance2/
    ├── scavenger-miner
    └── wallets.txt
```

**Run each instance:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd instance1
./scavenger-miner --cpu 50

# Terminal 2
cd instance2
./scavenger-miner --cpu 50
```

**Considerations:**
- Total CPU usage = sum of all instances
- More instances ≠ more tokens (round-robin still applies)
- Useful for different wallet groups
- Each instance maintains separate logs/solutions

### Automating Backups

**Linux/macOS cron job:**
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add daily backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cp -r /path/to/scavenger-miner/solutions /path/to/backup/solutions-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d)
```

**Windows Task Scheduler:**
Create a batch script `backup.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
set BACKUP_DIR=D:\Backups\Scavenger\solutions-%date:~-4,4%%date:~-10,2%%date:~-7,2%
xcopy C:\ScavengerMiner\solutions %BACKUP_DIR% /E /I /Y
```

Schedule in Task Scheduler to run daily.

### Monitoring with Scripts

**Check if miner is running (Linux):**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if pgrep -f "scavenger-miner" > /dev/null; then
    echo "Miner is running"
else
    echo "Miner is NOT running - restarting..."
    cd /path/to/miner
    nohup ./scavenger-miner --cpu 75 > miner.log 2>&1 &
fi
```

**Save as `check_miner.sh` and run hourly via cron:**
```bash
0 * * * * /path/to/check_miner.sh
```

### Solution Analysis

**Count your solutions:**
```bash
# Linux/macOS
find solutions/ -name "*.json" | wc -l

# PowerShell
(Get-ChildItem -Path solutions\ -Filter *.json).Count
```

**Calculate success rate:**
```bash
# Linux/macOS
grep -r "\"status\":\"submitted\"" solutions/ | wc -l
```

**Export to CSV:**
```python
import json
import glob
import csv

solutions = []
for file in glob.glob("solutions/*.json"):
    with open(file) as f:
        solutions.append(json.load(f))

with open("solutions_summary.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=["wallet_address", "challenge_id", "found_at", "status"])
    writer.writeheader()
    for sol in solutions:
        writer.writerow({
            "wallet_address": sol["wallet_address"][:20] + "...",
            "challenge_id": sol["challenge_id"],
            "found_at": sol["found_at"],
            "status": sol["status"]
        })
```

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to keep my wallet connected while mining?**

A: No. The miner only needs your wallet **addresses**, not access to your wallet. You never share private keys.

**Q: Will mining damage my CPU?**

A: No. CPUs are designed for sustained loads. However, ensure:
- Adequate cooling
- Temperatures under 80°C
- Don't overclock while mining

**Q: How much can I earn?**

A: Earnings depend on:
- Your CPU performance
- How long you mine
- The current difficulty
- Total network participants
- Your share of the profit ratio

### Technical Questions

**Q: What is the AshMaize algorithm?**

A: AshMaize is a memory-hard, ASIC-resistant variant of RandomX. It's designed so ordinary CPUs perform well, making mining fair and accessible.

**Q: Why does ROM initialization take so long?**

A: The ROM is 1GB of cryptographic data that must be generated. This is intentionally memory-intensive to prevent ASIC advantages. Once initialized, it's cached for reuse.

**Q: Can I use a VPS or cloud server?**

A: Yes, but:
- Check your hosting provider's terms of service
- Watch for "CPU steal" affecting performance
- Monitor costs - sustained high CPU may increase bills
- Some providers prohibit mining

**Q: Why do some solutions take longer than others?**

A: Finding a valid nonce is probabilistic. The difficulty target determines average time, but actual times vary:
- Some solutions: 30 seconds
- Others: 2 minutes
- Occasionally: 5+ minutes

This is normal and expected.

**Q: Can I pause and resume mining?**

A: Yes:
- Press Ctrl+C to stop
- Run the command again to resume
- No progress is lost (each solution is independent)
- Your wallet addresses remain registered

### Profit Sharing Questions

**Q: Can the operator steal my tokens?**

A: No. Your solutions are submitted directly to Scavenger Mine API with your wallet addresses. The operator never has access to your tokens.

**Q: Is the operator ratio fair?**

A: This depends on the service provided:
- Development and maintenance
- Infrastructure and hosting
- Support and documentation
- API access and coordination

Compare different operators and choose one you trust.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Why does the miner say "No tasks available"?**

A: For owner solutions, this means:
- The task queue is temporarily empty
- Wait 30 seconds and miner retries automatically
- Normal during periods between challenges

**Q: My hash rate seems lower than expected. Why?**

A: Common causes:
- Thermal throttling (check temperatures)
- Power saving mode enabled
- Other processes using CPU
- Laptop on battery (reduced performance)

**Q: Can I change wallets while mining?**

A: Yes, but you must:
1. Stop the miner (Ctrl+C)
2. Edit wallets.txt
3. Restart the miner

**Q: The miner is using too much electricity. What should I do?**

A: Reduce CPU usage:
```bash
scavenger-miner --cpu 50  # or --cpu 25
```

Lower CPU usage = lower power consumption = lower electricity cost.
